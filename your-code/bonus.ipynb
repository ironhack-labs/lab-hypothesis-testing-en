    "# Challenge 1 - T-test\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, t-test is used to test if two data samples have a significant difference between their means. There are two types of t-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Student's t-test** (a.k.a. independent or uncorrelated t-test). This type of t-test is to compare the samples of **two independent populations** (e.g. test scores of students in two different classes). `scipy` provides the [`ttest_ind`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html) method to conduct student's t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Paired t-test** (a.k.a. dependent or correlated t-test). This type of t-test is to compare the samples of **the same population** (e.g. scores of different tests of students in the same class). `scipy` provides the [`ttest_re`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html) method to conduct paired t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of t-tests return a number which is called the **p-value**. If p-value is below 0.05, we can confidently declare the null-hypothesis is rejected and the difference is significant. If p-value is between 0.05 and 0.1, we may also declare the null-hypothesis is rejected but we are not highly confident. If p-value is above 0.1 we do not reject the null-hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more about the t-test in [this article](https://researchbasics.education.uconn.edu/t-test/) and [this Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-paired-and-unpaired-t-test). Make sure you understand when to use which type of t-test. "

    "The  paired t-test results reveal that there is a significant difference between the Attack and Defense stats of all Pokémon, with a p-value of 1.71e-05, which is well below the 0.05 threshold. In contrast, the Special Attack and Special Defense stats do not show a significant difference, as indicated by a p-value of 0.39, which is much greater than 0.05. Therefore, we can conclude that while Attack and Defense differ significantly, there is no significant difference between Special Attack and Special Defense."
