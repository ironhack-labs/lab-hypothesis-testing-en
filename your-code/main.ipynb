    "In this challenge, we aimed to construct a **95% confidence interval** for the **mean hourly wage** of all hourly workers. Since the hourly wage data was not normally distributed (as confirmed by the **Shapiro-Wilk test**), we used **bootstrapping** as a non-parametric method to estimate the confidence interval for the mean.\n",

    "- **95% Confidence Interval**: (16.90, 17.48)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Bootstrapping is the Most Appropriate Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-parametric**: Bootstrapping is a **non-parametric** method that doesn't rely on any assumptions about the distribution of the data. In this case, since the hourly wage data was found to be **non-normally distributed**, bootstrapping is an ideal choice because it doesn't require the data to follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "- **Resampling with Replacement**: Bootstrapping works by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the original dataset, which allows us to approximate the sampling distribution of the mean. By generating a large number of resamples, we can calculate the confidence interval based on these simulated samples.\n",
    "- **Robust to Non-normality**: Unlike methods like the t-test, which assume normality, bootstrapping remains robust even when the data is skewed, contains outliers, or violates other assumptions. This makes it especially useful when dealing with real-world data that doesn't fit well-known distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "- The **95% confidence interval** means that we are 95% confident that the **true mean** of the hourly wage for all hourly workers in this dataset lies between **`$16.90`** and **`$17.48`**.\n",
    "- This interval provides us with a range of plausible values for the population mean based on the sample data. Since this is a **non-parametric method**, it does not rely on the assumption of normality, making it robust even for skewed data.\n",
